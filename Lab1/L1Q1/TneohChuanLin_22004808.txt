My name is Tneoh Chuan Lin with matrix number, 22004808. I am majoring in Bachelor Of Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence). This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling nervous about taking this subject. This is because I heard that Data Structures is a challenging subject that requires a solid understanding of programming concepts and algorithms. I am not confident in my programming skills.

I acquired B+ for my previous Programming 1 course. It's quite bad. So, I think I can manage to get A for this subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will finish all my homework on time and do revision frequently. XD Wish me luck!!!
